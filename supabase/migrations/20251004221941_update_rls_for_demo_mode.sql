/*
  # Update RLS Policies for Demo Mode
  
  ## Changes
  This migration temporarily modifies RLS policies to work without authentication
  for demo/development purposes. In production, you should use proper authentication.
  
  ## Security Note
  These policies allow access based on user_id matching, which is suitable for 
  demo purposes but should be replaced with proper auth.uid() checks in production.
